# Housing price prediction

## Data set: Ames housing dataset

Started with a naive baseline of predicting a constant value. After that tried linear regression, then moved to decision trees, random forests, then moved to AdaBoost and XGBoost.

XGBoost.inpynb contains the best try so far. It got into top 18% in Kaggle leaderboard.
